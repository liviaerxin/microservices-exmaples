[Lambda Expressions and Functional Interfaces: Tips and Best Practices](https://www.baeldung.com/java-8-lambda-expressions-tips)

What the major point is,

- Use the @FunctionalInterface Annotation
- Don’t Overuse Default Methods in Functional Interfaces
- Instantiate Functional Interfaces with Lambda Expressions
