# gRPC



## Basic Knowledge


## Protocol Buffer

[Language Guide (proto3)](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3)

- **extracts**

1. option fields definition, like `java_outer_classname`.

### Manage Protocol Buffer Files

## Work with gRPC


1. **Defining the service**


2. **Generating client and server code**

We need to generate the gRPC client and server interfaces from our `.proto` service definition file. To integrate these interfaces with our client or server implementation class, we can do this using following 2 steps,

- using protocol buffer [proto3](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases) compiler. Then import these java files into projects.  

- using Gradle or Maven(ignore step 1 as gradle/maven plugins automatically incorporate the complier). The protoc build plugin can generate the necessary code as part of the build. You can refer the [README](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/blob/master/README.md) for how to generate code from your own `.proto` files. 


3. **Creating the pseudo-server**




4. **Creating the client**





## Load Balancing

When gPRC servers are deployed in cluster such as microservices, `service discovery` and `load balancing` are entailed when client call server.

### Load Balancing Model

1. Proxy Load Balancer options
   - L3/L4 (Transport)
   - L7 (Application)
     - NGINX gRPC

2. Client side LB options
   - Thick client
    the data center middleware (service discovery service) can be selected as follows:
     - Consul

### Question

1. Does one client/stub send multiple requests simultaneously on opening multiple connections?

   Right also wrong, one stub can send multiple requests but one stub only bind to one channel/connection. gRPC's underlying transport protocol is `HTTP/2` which support [multiplexing](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/http2/#request_and_response_multiplexing) and is in way to be very important to reduce the network latency and improve the performance in comparison with `HTTP/1.1`.

   [](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/85)

   [Client](https://grpclib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/client.html)

2. How the gRPC client could discover which host is running the `service` it wishes to call?

   What I have known so far is that the service has full service name of `{package}.{service}` and the method also has full method name of `{package}.{service}/{method}`, which are unique to exist in a gRPC server. And the `*.proto` file does not tell the `server` host address or domain name but contains `{package}`, `{service}` and `{method}`. By now, the domain name of host which provides services is hard-coded into the client.

   ```java
   public final class GreeterGrpc {

   private GreeterGrpc() {}

   public static final String SERVICE_NAME = "helloworld.Greeter";
   ....
   ```

3. load-balanced in the transport layer (L3/L4) or application layer (L7)?
