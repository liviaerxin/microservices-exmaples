TensorFlow is the `ML(machine learning)` framework that Google created for numerical computation and large-scale machine learning, and mainly used to design, build and train deep learning models. TensorFlow bundles together a slew of machine learning and deep learning (aka neural networking) models and algorithms and makes them useful by way of a common metaphor.

## Keras

Keras is a high-level API to build and train `deep learning` models which is a subfield of `ML(machine learning)`. It's used for fast prototyping, advanced research, and production, with three key advantages:

- User friendly
Keras has a simple, consistent interface optimized for common use cases. It provides clear and actionable feedback for user errors.

- Modular and composable
Keras models are made by connecting configurable building blocks together, with few restrictions.

- Easy to extend
Write custom building blocks to express new ideas for research. Create new layers, loss functions, and develop state-of-the-art models.

## TensorRT

`TensorRT(TF-RT)` is supposed to accelerate inference in TensorFlow. It includes a deep learning inference optimizer and runtime that delivers low latency and high-throughput for deep learning inference applications.

### TensorRT Inference Server

[NVIDIA TensorRT Inference Server](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/tensorrt-inference-server-guide/docs/index.html)

the `model repository` lives in a directory on the file system.

```
/tmp/models             --- directory for model repository
   mymodel/             --- subdirectory for each model
      config.pbtxt      --- configuration file 
      3/                --- subdirectory holding a version of the model
         model.plan      
```

### TensorRT Inference Client





## TensorFlow Lite



## Basic Methods

- List host gpu

```sh
$ nvidia-smi
```

- List devices

```python
from tensorflow.python.client import device_lib

#local_device_protos = device_lib.list_local_devices()

def get_available_cpus():
    local_device_protos = device_lib.list_local_devices()
    return [x.name for x in local_device_protos if x.device_type == 'CPU']

def get_available_gpus():
    local_device_protos = device_lib.list_local_devices()
    return [x.name for x in local_device_protos if x.device_type == 'GPU']
```
