TensorFlow is the `ML(machine learning)` framework that Google created for numerical computation and large-scale machine learning, and mainly used to design, build and train deep learning models. TensorFlow bundles together a slew of machine learning and deep learning (aka neural networking) models and algorithms and makes them useful by way of a common metaphor.

## Keras

Keras is a high-level API to build and train `deep learning` models which is a subfield of `ML(machine learning)`. It's used for fast prototyping, advanced research, and production, with three key advantages:

- User friendly
Keras has a simple, consistent interface optimized for common use cases. It provides clear and actionable feedback for user errors.

- Modular and composable
Keras models are made by connecting configurable building blocks together, with few restrictions.

- Easy to extend
Write custom building blocks to express new ideas for research. Create new layers, loss functions, and develop state-of-the-art models.

## TensorRT

`TensorRT(TF-RT)` is supposed to accelerate inference in TensorFlow. It includes a deep learning inference optimizer and runtime that delivers low latency and high-throughput for deep learning inference applications.
